# Star_Wars_survey_investigation
9th guided project with DataQuest

This project investigates a Star Wars survey gathered by Nerd Quest and curated by DataQuest

In this project I first cleaned the rows I intended to use, then bar plotted the rankings provided by the survey. I determined that both men and women  preferred the older 3 episodes more than the newer 3 movies, and that Episode 5 was the favorite.
